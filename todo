**Deepen Your Understanding of Core Concepts: Asynchronous JavaScript**

<!-- Promises are objects in JavaScript that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. -->

<!-- async/await:  async and await are keywords in JavaScript that simplify working with Promises and asynchronous operations, including data fetching from an API.-->

<!-- Closures: are functions that are defined inside another function and have access to their own scope, the scope of the parent function, and the global scope. -->

<!-- Scope -->

<!-- Prototypes: -> Prototypes are a fundamental concept in JavaScript that allow objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. -->

<!-- Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. -->

**Version Control**
'git init' to initialize a new Git repository
<!-- 'git clone <repository-url>' to clone an existing repository -->
'git add .' to add everything to the staging area
<!-- 'git commit -m "message"' to commit changes with a message -->
'git push' to publish work to the remote repository
'git pull' to update the local repository with changes from the remote repository
'git status' to show the current status of the working directory
'git log' to view the commit history
'git branch' to list, create, or delete branches
'git checkout <branch-name>' to switch to a different branch
'git merge <branch-name>' to merge changes from one branch into the current branch
'git stash' to temporarily save changes that are not ready to be committed
'git remote -v' to view the remote connections
'git fetch' to download objects and refs from another repository

## Git Configurations:

'git config --global user.name "Your Name"' to set your Git username
'git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"' to set your Git email
Branch Management:
'git branch -d <branch-name>' to delete a branch
'git branch -m <new-branch-name>' to rename the current branch

## Rebasing:

'git rebase <branch-name>' to reapply commits on top of another base tip

## Tagging:

'git tag <tag-name>' to create a new tag
'git tag -d <tag-name>' to delete a tag

## Viewing Differences:

'git diff' to show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc.

## Undoing Changes:

'git reset --hard <commit-id>' to reset the working directory to a specific commit
'git revert <commit-id>' to create a new commit that undoes changes from a previous commit
